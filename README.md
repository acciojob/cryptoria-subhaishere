# Cryptoria

## Instructions

In the ancient Indian kingdom of Cryptoria, there lived a wise and renowned scholar named Aryabhatta. He was known for his ability to solve complex mathematical problems and create ingenious encryption techniques. Aryabhatta was the trusted advisor to King Ashoka, who valued his counsel and insight.

One day, King Ashoka received confidential messages from his spies across the kingdom. To protect the information from falling into the wrong hands, the messages were encrypted using Aryabhatta's famous Caesar's cipher.

King Ashoka asked Aryabhatta to decrypt the messages and save the information in a secure place. Aryabhatta decided to use the kingdom's Local Storage, a magical vault that could safely store important information.

However, the messages were received in a random order, and King Ashoka wanted the information sorted by the date they were sent. Aryabhatta realized that the best way to sort the messages would be to use his Merge sort algorithm and then combine the sorted messages using the technique of merging two sorted arrays.

Can you help Aryabhatta decrypt, sort, and securely store the messages in the kingdom's Local Storage?

Task 1: Decrypt messages using Caesar's cipher
Create a JavaScript function called decryptMessage that takes two parameters: an encrypted message (string) and a shift (integer). The function should decrypt the message using Caesar's cipher and return the decrypted message as a string.

Task 2: Sort the messages by date using Merge sort
Create a JavaScript function called sortMessages that takes an array of objects as input. Each object represents a message, with properties 'date' and 'content'. Sort the messages in ascending order by date using the Merge sort algorithm and return the sorted array of messages.

Task 3: Store the sorted messages in Local Storage
Create a JavaScript function called storeMessages that takes an array of message objects as input. Save the array to the kingdom's Local Storage under the key 'messages'.

Help Aryabhatta decrypt, sort, and securely store the messages in the kingdom's Local Storage by completing the tasks above.
